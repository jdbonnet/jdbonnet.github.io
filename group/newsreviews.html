<h3><em>Reviews </em></h3>
  
 <p> Thank you so much for the fresh produce that my family has been picking up the last few months. We’ve never been healthier or happier. -L. Spring</p>

<p>I love the monthly recipes, so simple and straightforward. I try to make them all and always look forward to when new ones are posted. -T.Messing</p>

<p> The idea of joining a CSA was new to me. I was introduced by a close friend. I was hesitant at first because I was already so familiar and comfortable with the local farmers market. Eventually I figured, why not. So happy I did and I haven’t looked back. The produce is as fresh as if I had grown and picked it myself, but without all of the work. I was blown away! It usually doesn’t disappoint to break out of your comfort zone, never know what you may discover. Thank you so much!! -B.Smith</p>

<p> I never knew how truly amazing tomatoes could taste, wow! Thank you so very much for all the work you do. -R.Rodriguez </p>

<p> I recently completed my first months order and I am delighted. The only regret I have, not joining sooner. -A.Williams </p>

<p> I've always had a hard a time getting my family to eat more fruits and vegetables. Joining HOME GROWN has been the best decision for us. There is nothing that can replace the taste of fresh fruits and vegetables.- A very happy customer </p>
