<h2>Pricing</h2>
    <div class="prices">
        <p><strong>Big Basket</strong> - Our value-sized assortment of seasonal and local fare available for approx. $32 a week.  </p>
        <p><strong>Sampler Basket</strong> - Our most popular service for dependable farm-fresh food at approx. $24 a week. </p>

        <p>The member's basket at our pick-up market location or farm comes with a pre-selected variety of fruits and vegetables, but the member may also choose 5 lbs (Big Basket) or 2 lbs (Sampler Basket) of other available greens and orange-sticker staples (tomatoes, onion, garlic, carrots, corn, potatoes etc.)</p>
        <p>From April 1, our subscription model runs for 27 weeks (about 6.5 months) and comes with an extra "Harvest Basket"  in early September
        to show our appreciation for committing to be a CSA member. Families may arrange to share a membership (pick-up every other week), 
        and each membership allows you to defer up to 2 pick-ups to double up the next week if you can't make a pick-up.</p>

        <h2>Distribution</h2>
        <p>Deliveries are made on Sundays at our local market stalls 11AM-3PM and open hours for our partner stores. Pick-up is also welcome at the farm Mondays and Thursdays 1-6 PM, and a farm pick-up discount of 15% is possible for members who forego local market pickups.
        We enjoy showing our subscribers where their food is coming from, so stop by anytime!</p>
