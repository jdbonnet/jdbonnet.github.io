        <h2>What is Forunity?</h2>
        <h4>Run for Unity, or Forunity, is a run/walk conceived to celebrate bringing people together and recognize the importance of unity. On the course, members from the diverse communities of NYC and beyond will cross from island to island, symbolically showing the connection of our communities. As a running mass of individuals, we will be exemplifying inclusion while appreciating differences.</h4>
        <h4>Runners and walkers are both welcome at Run for Unity! Awards for best time and costumes will let us appreciate particular participants from the unified crowd. If you didn't have a chance to talk on the course, feel free to interact at the finish line festival area, featuring live music and a market of global cuisine.</h4>
            
        <h4>Early-bird registration is $15 until October 1, 2019 and will rise $10 thereafter. Admission includes a shirt distributed upon receiving your bib, and access to tie-dye stations at the finish for customization.</h4>
